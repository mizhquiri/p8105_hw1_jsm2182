# Problem 1.A

Below I create a data frame called **problem1_df** comprised of the following:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

problem1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  greater_than_0_logical = (samp>0),
  vec_char = c("This" , "is" , "a" , "ten", "character" , "vector" , "for" , "this" ,  "problem" , "set"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("level_a" , "level_b" , "level_c" , "level_b" , "level_c" , "level_c" , "level_a" , "level_b" , "level_c" , "level_a"))
  )

problem1_df
```

#Problem 2
```{r}

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")


```
